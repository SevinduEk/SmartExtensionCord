# Smart Extension Cord 
The Smart Extension Cord Group project, developed as part of the semester 5 (EN3023) Electronic Deisgn Realization module, is a web-controlled extension cord with independent socket control. 
The project enables users to remotely control each socket of the extension cord through a web interface. This allows convenient management of connected devices, providing the ability to turn individual sockets on or off from anywhere with internet access.
