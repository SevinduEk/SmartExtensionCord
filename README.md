<h2>Smart Extension Cord</h2>
<p>The Smart Extension Cord Group project, developed as part of the semester 5 (EN3023) Electronic Design Realization module, is a web-controlled extension cord with independent socket control.</p>
<p>The project enables users to remotely control each socket of the extension cord through a web interface. This allows convenient management of connected devices, providing the ability to turn individual sockets on or off from anywhere with internet access.</p>
